🔧 Getting Started
Requires PHP 8.1+ and Node.js (with NPM).

Clone the repository and enter the directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aminssmilee/ticketing-system.git
cd ticketing-system
```

Initial Setup
1. **Install Backend Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```
2. **Environment Configuration**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   *Make sure to configure your database settings in the `.env` file.*

3. **Generate Application Key**:
   ```bash
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

4. **Run Migrations & Seeders**:
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate --seed
   ```

5. **Install Frontend Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

6. **Start the Development Servers**:
   ```bash
   # Run Vite development server (hot-reloads changes)
   npm run dev

   # In a separate terminal, start the Laravel server
   php artisan serve
   ```

Verify Installation
To run the PHPUnit test suite:
```bash
php artisan test
```

👑 Creating an Admin User
By default, users registered via the sign-up form are assigned the standard `'user'` role. To promote an account to Admin:

1. Register an account through the application UI.
2. Open your database or run Laravel Tinker:
   ```bash
   php artisan tinker
   ```
3. Update the user's role:
   ```php
   \App\Models\User::where('email', 'your-email@example.com')->update(['role' => 'admin']);
   ```

📊 Performance Optimizations
- **Eager Loading**: Enforced relations eager loading (`load()`, `with()`) to eliminate N+1 database queries.
- **Inertia SPA Flow**: Smooth UI changes without page refreshes, reducing payloads and backend processing overhead.
- **Asset Minimization**: Compiled production bundles utilizing tree-shaking and minification via Vite.

🎯 Future Enhancements
- Real-time ticket updates and notifications (Laravel Echo / Websockets).
- SLA (Service Level Agreement) duration tracking & indicators.
- Automated email alerts on ticket creation and status updates.
- PDF export options for tickets and summary sheets.
